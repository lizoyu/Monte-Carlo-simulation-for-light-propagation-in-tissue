This is a class project in Optical microscopy and Imaging, using Monte Carlo method to simulate light 
propagation in tissue, assuming it's a single layer. It's written in Matlab.

It should be noticed that it's not a complete simulation of light propagation in tissue. First, it only
simulates the situation in single-layered tissues. Second, it only records the absorption distribution in
x-z plane and fluence, while the complete version should also records diffuse reflectance and transmittance.

The theoritical details can be found in the reference.
